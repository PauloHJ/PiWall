## Welcome to my PiWall Guide

This tutorial has the intention of walking you through the necessary steps to successfully configure your PiWall, also known as a multiscreen application with Raspberry Pis. It´s important to point out that this tutorial is based on the [PiWall](https://piwall.co.uk/) proyect developed by Alex Goodyear, Colin Hogben & Dr. Adam Stephen.
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PauloHJ/piwall/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/PauloHJ/piwall/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
