# PiWall - Configuration Guide

This tutorial has the intention of walking you through the necessary steps to successfully configure your PiWall, also known as a multiscreen application with Raspberry Pis. It's important to point out that this tutorial is based on the [PiWall](https://piwall.co.uk/) proyect developed by Alex Goodyear, Colin Hogben & Dr. Adam Stephen.

This simple guide is divided in 4 main sections:
- Materials
- Configuration
- Hardware Connections
- Displaying on screen

## Overview

PiWall is a smart solution developed in 2013 to configure a video wall. According to the Collins English Dictionary, a video wall can be defined as "multiple computer monitors, video projectors, or television sets tiled together contiguously or overlapped in order to form one large screen".

In this way, a PiWall must have a master computer/Raspberry Pi that is in charge of storing and distributing the video signal across the tiles of the video wall. Each tile has the job of displaying a part of the picture in its assigned screen. At the end, all the tiles together form a wall with a unique video playing.
