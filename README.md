# PiWall - Configuration Guide

This tutorial has the intention of walking you through the necessary steps to successfully configure your PiWall, also known as a multiscreen application with Raspberry Pis. It's important to point out that this tutorial is based on the [PiWall](https://piwall.co.uk/) proyect developed by Alex Goodyear, Colin Hogben & Dr. Adam Stephen.

This simple guide is divided in 4 main sections:
- Materials
- Configuration
- Hardware Connections
- Displaying on screen

## Overview
PiWall is a smart solution developed in 2013 to configure a video wall. According to the Collins English Dictionary, a video wall can be defined as 
>multiple computer monitors, video projectors, or television sets tiled together contiguously or overlapped in order to form one large screen".

![Video wall example](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/rpi-video-wall.png?w=876&h=522)

In this way, a PiWall must have a master computer/Raspberry Pi that is in charge of storing and distributing the video signal across the tiles of the video wall. Each tile has the job of displaying a part of the picture in its assigned screen. At the end, all the tiles together form a wall with a unique video playing.

## Materials

In order to build a PiWall some materials are required. It's important to point out that this guide describes the materials I used. However, it's possible to use different resources that provide the same or even better solution to the one stated in this guide. 

**HARDWARE**
-Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (1 master + _n_ tiles)*
    For each Raspberry:
        -Micro USB B Power Supply (2.5 A, 5.1 V)
        -Micro SD card (> 2 GB)
-Screens
-HDMI Cable (1 x _n_ screen)
-Wireless router

*For example, if your PiWall is 3x3 screens, then you'll need 1 RaspberryPi for each, plus 1 more for the master. 10 Raspberry Pi in total
